i tried to upload all datasets but some datasets were too large that they could not upload ,
so here is the link to those datasets you can download them from here

COSINE SIMILIARITY


Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The output value ranges from 0â€“1.
0 means no similarity, where as 1 means that both the items are 100% similar.
The python Cosine Similarity or cosine kernel, computes similarity as the normalized dot product of input samples X and Y. 
The cosine_sim matrix is a numpy array with calculated cosine similarity between each movies.
